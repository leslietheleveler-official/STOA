Experimental Proposals:

CERN experiment to confirm or deny the gluon is simply a force like gravity and not a particle:
1. Develop an AI specific to the task of analyzing trillions of relativistic hadron collisions and their gluon jets for certain patterns.
2. Conduct said collisions.
3. Look for patterns that prove the tetraction hypothesis AND patterns which disprove the tetraction hypothesis.
4. Eventually, patterns will emerge that humans can't quantify. An AI trained to *just look for these patterns* could determine if the gluon hypothesis of the STOA is flawed or not.

TGIO (Tetrahedral Gravity-Interferometer Observatory) is equally simple, but far harder to implement:
1. Design a launch vehicle to place a singular massive hub in a position above or below the plane of the solar system, to avoid gravitic interference from the gas giants.
2. Once in place, the hub would deploy four platforms (reserving eight backup platforms) that each contain the following devices:
  a. three powerful infrared lasers
  b. three laser recievers
  c. carbon nanotube coating to absorb solar radiation and minimize light pressure disrupting the platform positions
  d. ion engines powered by the heat produced by the nanotube coating
  e. communication with the central hub.
3. The hub would deploy the four platforms tetrahedrally at a distance of several million kilometers. The hub would relay data back to Earth for LIGO-type analysis to figure out the true geometry of space. This process would likely take decades.
