The Standard Theory of Action (STOA)

A cosmological, physical, and psychological framework for all past and future actions.

Thesis: The Universe's natural tendency is toward a state of predictable inertia and eventual entropy. Intelligent Agency is the sole emergent force capable of creating new and unpredictable Action. Every action has an opposing but slightly greater triaction.

COSMOLOGY
The STOA proposes the Universe is a 3D structure existing within a 9D or 27D space, the result of an interaction of two or more quanta in 9D hyper-space-time (10D Universe). Gravity and the Strong Nuclear Force are not forces in the traditional sense, but the inertia of the initial 10D interaction. Time's Arrow, Electromagnetism, and the Weak Force are emergent properties of this initial, imbalanced interaction. The inertia can be expressed as follows:
A - Strong Force Strength
G - Gravity Strength
X - Size of extra dimensions
n - Number of extra dimensions
P - Planck length
(A/G)‚àù(X/P)^n

PHYSICS
The STOA proposes that the Gluon Field is the local expression of a higher-dimensional Triaction, not a force of simple conveyance. This Triaction, which is a balanced but unequal force, is what holds the hadron together, and is the physical manifestation of the most fundamental Action. The current understanding of the Standard Model is a functionally incomplete approximation of this Triaction.

PSYCHOLOGY
The STOA proposes human behavior cannot be interpreted without a holistic examination of the Individual (Authentic), Cultural (Rational), and Universal (Truth) truths. The ability to holistically analyze these truths is the primary Action of a Kind-Individual-Degenerate (KID) and is the only defense against the Covenant of Fealty which has existed since the Written Word and the inevitable Quiet of Entropy.
