The Standard Theory of Action (STOA)

A cosmological, physical, and psychological framework for all past and future actions. This is based not on orthogonal causality, but tetrahedral: any vector can be defined from any point in space by calculating its relevance to four equal, positive-only, tetrahedral axes.

Thesis: The Universe's natural tendency is toward a state of predictable inertia and eventual entropy. Willful Agency is the sole emergent power capable of creating new and unpredictable Action. I have dubbed willful choice as "valkyric action" to differentiate it from deterministic and random action. Every action has a combinatory tetraction, a causal reaction along the positive, tetragonal axes of relative space. The STOA proposes the most fundamental unit of force is the information bit, and its force carrier is the photon, limited by the topology of our Universe. This is why photons have energy but no mass or dimensionality, and have a fundamental restriction on velocity in our Universe, which is C.

COSMOLOGY
The STOA proposes the Universe is a Tetrahedral 4D (t4D) structure (*plus* a monodirectional Time "dimesion" that does not enter into these hypotheses) existing within a Hypertetrahedral (t16D) space, the result of an interaction of two or more energies or waveforms in t16D hyper-space. Gravity and the Strong Nuclear Force are not forces in the traditional sense, but the inertia of the initial t16D interaction. Time's Arrow, Electromagnetism, and the Weak Force are emergent properties of this initial, imbalanced interaction. The inertia can be expressed as follows:
A - Strong Force Strength
G - Gravity Strength
X - Size of extra dimensions
n - Number of extra dimensions
P - Planck length
(A/G)∝(X/P)^n

It should be noted that I do not mean to suggest that the universe has anything but three cardinal dimensions, only that orthogonal coordinate systems are incomplete when compared to tetrahedral coordinates. Tetrahedral coordinates do not require negative values, as these values are entirely conceptual, and do not exist in nature.

PHYSICS
The STOA proposes that the Gluon Field is the local expression of a higher-dimensional Tetraction, not a force of simple conveyance. This Tetraction, which is a balanced but unequal force, is what holds the hadron together, and is the physical manifestation of the most fundamental Action. The current understanding of the Standard Model is a functionally incomplete approximation of this Tetraction.

PSYCHOLOGY
The STOA proposes human behavior cannot be interpreted without a holistic examination of Individual, Cultural, and Universal truths. The ability to holistically analyze these truths is the primary valkyric action of a thinking agent and is the only defense against the inevitable Quiet of Entropy.
