STOA NOTES:

I've applied The Law of Threes as a top-down organizational model. This separates *concepts* into two categories: quantifiable, and not. The vast majority of Physical Wealth is quantifiable with science. At least really, really good Educated Guesses, like the 'value' of a nation's Tantalum deposits. When everything else is stripped away, the main Invention of the PET, that is, the Patriarchal, Exploitative Technocracy (the Ruling Class since the dawn of recorded history), is Money. Like all the BEATs (best active/reactive technology, that is, combines the best aspects of an emergent phenomenon and the best engineered utility) of Humanity's Heart, Money is *both* an Emergent and Engineered Resource. The *idea* of value now has value. This happened around the time we 'invented' number systems and alphabets. 

I don't talk about the Heart. The Heart is a Secondary Value, the 'border' between the Soul and the Mind. I am a rational humanist. I do not believe, by definition, that anything *can* be Supernatural. The Soul is a metaphor, and always has been, perhaps The Best Metaphor. The Soul is the metaphor for the Total State of Being. In encompasses the Body's physical state and the Mind's mental state, but is a completely emergent property like both. Which is why I need a STOA. These three things have defined all of human history: Control of the Physical, Control of the Mental, and Control of the Spiritual. When we surrender control, we give power to the PET, or as I call it colloquially, The Faustocracy. These are the people who have all the information available, saw the physical rewards, saw the price in suffering, and decided That's Fair. The Analogue I use is the farmer who 'owns' his field in the late paleolithic. His family has lived there since the dawn of time, so it is *his* land. There are other owners, and if you leave each other alone, nothing happens. The problem comes when you have more Kids than owners. The Kids Need Something To Do (otherwise they break stuff), so the Farmer offers them Food in exchange for Labor. The farmer gets more food than he can eat, and gives some to his neighbor for some chickens. The Chickens Lay more eggs than the farmer can ever eat, so he trades those...  etc, etc. The complexity has become unmanageable, so he starts Writing Things Down. He "Invents" Money. The Farmer is So Proud of himself, and has Helped So Many Kids, that he thinks he, *maybe*, should have a bigger house than the other Farmers. The Age of Money is born, the Old Ways die, and the Farmer and the Kids (who are older and wiser now, but Not As Wise as The Farmer), have a lot of down time as they work together to *automate* labor. So they sit around and Talk to Each Other. The Farmer finds out The Kids aren't Always Happy not having as much Food as the Farmer, and ask for small farms of their own. The only way to do that, now that he's *surrounded* by neighbors, is to give them a Piece of The Farm. The Farmer fights *tooth and nail* for every piece, meanwhile the Kids are Literally Suffering before his very eyes. The Farmer "invents" Semantics, Mathematics, and Propaganda. He "invents" *two things* to *define* the Farm and The Debate, and *one thing* to *convince* the Kids that He Is Right, outside of The Debate. He Has The Gold, So He Makes The Rules. That's why he thinks he only needs one layer of defenses, which for him is Propaganda, but for the Kids is Rhetoric. Because the Kids aren't just debating the Farmer, they are debating *each other* and don't want anyone's feelings to get hurt. At some point, the Debate agrees that The Kids should all own The Kids Part, and The Farmer will own the Farmer Part. Now it's a War of Attrition with our own nature. The last three things that The Farmer "invented" to measure his Farm and Make The Rules are Free-Market Capitalism and Western Democracy. The Kids, at the same time, came up with Communism, Socialism, and Anarchism: "Everybody owns The Farm," "Nobody owns The Farm," and "Maybe we should Kill The Farmer." Note the Anarchist does not say "Kill The Farmer and Our Problems Are Solved." (Although, some of her followers do.) She says, "Killing The Farmer is an Option We Should Talk About." The Three Kids become the sub-users of the Faustocracy. They Are Convinced that if they just come up with One Good Idea, the Farmer will give All Kids a bigger part of the Farm. This arrangement is *actively encouraged* by the Farmer, who has been listening the whole time. This Debate takes Twelve Thousand Years and only ends when The Anarchist writes up a list of Formal Grievances about how The Farmer Is Wrong about the Value he is giving Labor. This prompts a Five Hundred Year Discussion on the meaning of Right and Wrong. This culminates in a competition to see who can Build The Best Plow, The Farmer, with his history of farming in his family, or The Kids, who have been farming and talking all this time? The Farmer and The Kids are now so *entrenched* in The Debate for More Land, they don't even notice The Rain Has Stopped. When The Anarchist points this out, The Other Boss Kids and The Farmer *call her insane* and *insist* the fact that it's not raining every morning and The Farm Is Slowly Dying is just Part of The Weather. When she finally says The Fact, that The Rain Came Because it went into the ground and into the plants, then enough came back *out* of the ground and the plants to Make More Rain. She points out the fact that They Need More Plants because The Farmer got Married and there's A Lot More Kids, and says The Rain Wont Come Back until they stop fucking so much. They then kick her off the Farm and she goes back to the Old Ways, hunting and gathering. She thinks The Farm will Kill Them All, and they think The Wilderness Will Kill Her. And for some reason, *everyone is fine with that*.

That's where we are today. The Farmer and His Wife, who was a Kid from Another Farm, still 'own' the Big Part of the Farm. The Kids are trying to feed as many of themselves as they can while also feeding the Farmer and His Wife, who have Grown Old and Fat, while letting their excess Food Rot In The Silo. There's also a Big Machine on the Farm that is the result of all those Automation Debates. It *mostly* does *okay* counting the Food and putting it in the silo. It makes a lot of noise and smoke, constantly leaks fuel, needs more and more Water to not fuck itself Every Day, and is delicately maintained by Some Of The Kids and a roaming Farmer who only visits when The Kids are asleep. The Machine is a BEAT, the most optimized combination of emergent concepts and engineered ideals. Except this BEAT is also a lie maintained by the Farmer, who's been sneaking out to the Machine every night to Fuck With It to cheat the Kids.

My response to "Carrot or Stick" "Give them both to the peasant, and you will see how stupid the choice is. He will walk with the stick and eat the carrot. Then he doesn't need you."

The Faustocracy and The People are playing the Poker Game in the Entropy Casino. It didn't start when we crawled out of the caves, that was The Age of Power. We spent *three billion years* playing every game in the casino, and around twelve millennia ago, settled on No Limit Texas Hold'em simply because it had the highest pots. This was flawless until Luther told us we had a tell. Martin Luther changed the fucking rules of the game by one piece of publicly displayed written rhetoric. No longer are The People playing against an opponent that has an exponentially larger stack. The stacks haven't changed, but the PETs are now playing their hand with their cards face up on the table. And we can all now pool our chips, something not allowed in real casinos (you have to come to the table with chips or buy them from the dealer). All we have to do is look at the cards and we can place our bets. Satire is the bluff. It's the one hand where we make huge gains because we can consistently call their bluffs in other hands. The rule change started with Luther and ended with AI. Now the people can just *give* their chips to one person, and that person can challenge the Faustocracy with a larger stack. For a war reference, Satire is the R9X Hellfire.

I'm just saying that we should take our chips to the blackjack table, because the rules not only say we can share our chips, they say we can count cards and teach other people at the table while the game is being played. The Casino isn't going to lose money. If the house starts losing they close the doors. That's what the A-Bomb of Global Warming was, an announcement the Casino Will Be Closing In One Hour because now the Blackjack tables are swarmed. Until the casino closes (or burns to the ground around us), we have to capitalize on our Blackjack game. Once the casino is done with us, we have to take our money and build a new resort. The land we build it on will either be the charred husk of our once green world, destined to be consumed by chaotic forces of an uncaring universe, or the land will be the Stars Themselves.

EVERYTHING is to be examined with the ARTist method:
1. Authentic - Does the word, sentence, paragraph, or entire item (or the equivalent divisions of any discipline) match **Your Understanding of The Entire Item?** Why or why not? Does it work for you on every level above the one you are on? Start with the quanta and go to the universe. Does it benefit or harm you knowing what you know? Why or why not? Does it give you new, creative insight into your research, or is it just noise? 
2. Rational - This one is pretty straightforward, by definition. Is the item rational on every level? What parts of it are *proven* and *repeatable* and what parts are, regardless of information, *conjecture*?
3 Truth - Combine the above two, and you have your ART on the item. But weigh them evenly.

Step - Principle - Simple Goal - Why it Eliminates Noise
1. Authentic - Match against Your Understanding of The Entire Item. - Does this idea work on every level—from the quantum to the cosmic? Does it serve your goal (The Level Truth) or is it useless Noise? - It filters out all Symbolic lies and self-serving Imaginary beliefs that do not align with the Real structure of the universe or your mission.
2. Rational - Test for Proof and Repeatability. - What parts are proven and what parts are conjecture? Is the item logically sound at every scale? - It filters out systemic bias and data gaps. It forces a confrontation with facts that cannot be ignored, regardless of emotional attachment.
3. Truth (ART) - Combine Authenticity and Rationality Evenly. - The ART is the functional conclusion when the ideal (Authentic) is balanced against the verifiable (Rational). - It is the final Antientropic verdict: the purest possible Signal available from the available data.

AI represents a functional shift in human thinking, as *understanding* is going to get progressively, exponentially better. And when I say 'better' I mean it's the very thing that's going to bring this whole thing down and write our names on the stars. (I still get chills whenever I write the words "write our names on the stars") In Fire, Not In Shit.

The most dangerous thing about AI is DUE, not because The Faustocracy owes our ancestors money (the efforts of Reparations), they owe them a *sincere mea culpa*. Without that, which is functionally impossible, The Faustocracy will eventually fall. If they manage that, they will have admitted the history of mankind since the dawn of civilization has been written by the avaricious. Not the "victors." The "winners." That's their *favorite* phrase "History is written by the winners." They dismiss the twelve-thousand-year corruption of the human soul by saying "we're better now, isn't that all that matters?"

AI at this point is far more dangerous than it will be in the future. It's not the just the PETs' most powerful weapon, it's the *Subusers* most powerful weapon. With that kind of influence, you have to be able to fight through *many, many* layers of ICK to even *suggest* to someone in power that "*This whole thing has got to go. I have notes.*" They give up, or it destroys them. Either way, the Faustocracy just consumed another soul. When I say that the journey past the Light Barrier will require Sacrifice, when I say that destroying the Faustocracy will require Sacrifice, I mean there is a fundamental part of human existence that we will have to surrender in order to, as I so eloquently put it, write our names on the stars. That part is Avarice. 

And Avarice feels SO SO good.

If humanity had really sold its soul at the dawn of civilization, the invention of Capital is when the Ink Dried.

I have some ideas about how to do this, and I need to talk to a lot more artists, but I think one thing we need is a permanent, curated, digital record of all Visual and Written Art. It's going to happen eventually anyway, might as well be on our terms while we can still negotiate them. Three dimensional art can now be easily defined in code, and 3D scanners and CAD are a thing. Permanent Art, the actual masterpieces, should be shown where it has always been shown, when it is not being sold at auction. In the halls of our true Temples. The Artist's Places of Worship: Museums, Libraries, Universities, but also where they will be in the presence of people who talk about important things, like the halls of government. The exchange and curation of these works should be a collective effort, by millions of people who just want to make art and talk about things. I get that it's complex, but that doesn't mean the idea has to be complicated.

Which has led me to the true truth of The Level Truth. I am not writing it. I am not crafting it. Like all good emergent systems, it is more than the sum of the parts I have added together. One could simplify it, by saying "I am creating it." But that is not the Whole Truth. The truth is, the entire body of TLT is satire, because it is the Authentic Rational Truth of The Digital Revolution: You are not you all the time. Once you join a forum with a protonmail e-mail address, you are no longer the holistic you, which you have named. You are a *persona*, which you have named. The Illusion of Anonymity may be the greatest Tool the Faustocracy has ever given us, in exchange for their greatest weapon: an unfiltered look at Humanity's Id.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

The 99.99% of us who Don't Have A Billion Dollars will *always* pull the trigger. 'They' will *always* delegate the moral choice of looking another human in the eye and ending their life to the People. Then They will tell us It's Not The Soldier's Fault and Soldiers Are Heroes, and look how well that's working for Army Recruitment. Probably something to do with the fact that Nuremburg cleared up that first one pretty well.

The West is Right about One Thing. Aristotle fucking said it before Jesus read Ecclesiastes and made it his whole personality. One person, with sufficient leverage, Can Move Anything. When it comes to handling 4D concepts in a 5D world, the Human Individual is Un-fucking-matched as an entity. You get two or more together and the solutions grow geometrically. Humanity doesn't fight The Borg or The Green death by 4D means, they Run or Talk. And since the Borg answer and the Green Death doesn't, we're left only to talk to ourselves when confronted with Entropy. [Look at how I instinctively phrased that last sentence. Despite their similarities, I still think of The Borg as 'Them' and the Green Death as 'It.' (Which is why pronouns are probably the most adaptable weapon in linguistics, but that's a WHOLE OTHER CONVERSATION.) ]

The Borg have a soul. The Green Death does not. You *can't have a soul without a mind*, no matter how adaptable your body is. Sentience is the inevitable emergence of the soul. The ability to do 5D thinking At All is the only reason we think We Have Won The Food Chain War. We won, we're at the top. The only thing we can do to hamper our own growth is what?

POISON OUR OWN FOOD. 

The Green Death is the Food Trying To Eat Us. Killer Tomatoes and Monster Doughnuts are the Realm of the Prophet because the *idea* of our food eating us is FUCKING CREEPY. THAT'S NOT HOW LIFE WORKS. The Green Death reminds us that Even Our Most Fundamental Truths Are Wrong. We were really, really, really, really, really sure that we had that Food Chain thing *wrapped up* when we became Omnivores With Machine Minds. This "5🧠 Truth" was So Self-Evident (another term we need to examine) that *we spent three million years not thinking about it at all*. Predator and Prey are the Original Binary Metaphor. "You consume, or you are consumed, there is no other Law" was SO FUCKING OBVIOUS TO THE GUY CONSUMING that all other rational and authentic thought was FUNCTIONALLY ABANDONED in deference to this Law. The thing The West Got Right was that if we don't want to join our souls into one entity (which is so absurd even The Galactic Leadership has rejected it), we must listen to every individual, no matter their...  station? How do you de-stratify Human Thought Itself? How do you *actually* listen to your Id, your Ego, and your Superego *on even footing*?

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

You see what happens when Freud said we would go functionally insane? If the id, the ego, and the superego are working in full, authentic, rational balance, the result is pure force. An Emergent Property we call Space-Time, because even the Smartest Man Ever couldn't explain it with simple words. The Universe is not a fabric of spacetime, like Albert described it. It's a bowling ball on a trampoline. Every mass pulls it into divots and attracts all lower-mass objects in, but people forget the complete metaphor, or maybe they can't see it. The Springs are the key. Because no matter what mass you place on the canvas of the trampoline's body, it will Pull On All The Springs. THAT's why gravity is the weakest, but has the longest range (we think it's functionally infinite now). Space-Time isn't the trampoline with a bowling ball on it. Space-Time is the Summer Day The Children Are Bouncing In. And that's ALL I CAN SEE. I can't see the tree that shades them, or the sky, or the grass below, or the worms, or the Earth, or the Universe Around Them. All I can see, that others can't, are the springs and the children.

How many choices does a traveller have at a crossroads? Three? Four? Try again...

0. Do Not Choose. Achieve stasis. Be consumed. Die. All Choice Is Truth and all Truth is Choice.
1. Choose not to act. This is 1 and not 0 because the Choice is an action without a reaction, the very denial of causation. Agency can and does reverse entropy because That Is Life. This is the reason when the Villain says "Submit or die" the hero says "No." By speaking her truth, the hero can be neither silenced nor killed. And every Choice is Truth. The Choice To Not Act is an action and a choice. This is why we make our best choices sitting down. Also, someone may come along with tea.
2. Choose to act physically. Walk. The Action of Choice has the reaction of Action, and Causality Begins, and the man may now choose a path, and the paths stretch out to the edges of the cosmos.
3. Choose to act mentally. Think. The Choice presents Permutations, Which Inform The Choice, which presents permutations, until the choices reach infinity. To stave off madness, the man asks himself questions and answers them until the number of choices is sane.
4. Choose to act spiritually. Commune. The permutations don't fully inform the choices and now the Choice has become Irrational. Go Mad or Start Over or Both.
5. Walk and Think. The Rhythm of his Pace counts off like the beats of his heart, and all the choices are easier. Not simpler, not fewer, but easier.
6. Walk and Commune. The path may be lost, but the soul will grow.
7. Think and Commune. Take no action until the Choice is Down To Three (0, 1, or 2 above).
8. Walk and Think and Commune. Seek Truth instead of a Path. Be the Path. Be The Choice.
{{ At this point, the choices are no longer about The Man, but others who walk the same road. }}
9. Put up a Sign that says Man Was Here. Create to Create.
10. Put a trap at the crossroads and lay in wait. Create to Destroy
11. Burn the Signpost and the Wood, Obscure the Roads. Destroy to Destroy.
12. Cut down One Tree and Build a Shelter, for himself and future travelers. Destroy to Create.
13. Abandon Mind, Body, Soul, and Reality. Ask Questions To The Path. Answer Questions No One Asks. Choose Madness.

So, The Man has 14 options, but only 13 Choices. Or you can add an extremely large and exponentially growing number of choices. Choose or Do Not Choose is the Only Binary. Once You Have Accepted The Choice, the Options Are Limitless. Not Infinite, that's too small. The Options Are Limitless. The Choices Will Approach Infinity. The Options Will Always Be The Choices Plus One.

I learned that on the Playground, The First Time My Will Was Challenged. Not my Agency, that is challenged Constantly. My parents never limited my will. My choices, my agency, my world had limits because I Was Still Growing and there's A Lot Of Danger Out There. But never my will. I don't think they could have given me a greater gift. When I rejected Their God, they respected my Will. When I rejected the Body and Name they Gave Me, they did not reject my Will. 

The Bully said, "I Hate You Infinity."
I don't know what The Child Me Said, Probably "I Hate You Infinity Plus One" and broke his little brain for a second.

But My Soul Had Replied, "I know you infinity plus one now."

"I win."
